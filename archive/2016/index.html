    	  <h1>What is IndoorGML?</h1>
    	  <p>IndoorGML is an OGC standard for an open data model and XML schema for indoor spatial information. It aims to provide a common framework of representation and exchange of indoor spatial information. It is defined as an application schema of <a href="http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=20509">OGC Geographic Markup Language (GML) 3.2.1</a>.</p>

       	  <h3><a name="Motivations"></a>1. Motivations</h3>
   	      <p>Indoor  space differs from outdoor space in many aspects. Basic concepts, data models,  and standards of spatial information should be redefined to meet the  requirements of indoor spatial applications. The requirements of indoor spatial  information are differently specified according to the types of applications. In  general, the applications of indoor spatial information are classified into two  categories as follows;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Management of building components and  indoor facilities and</li>
            <li>Usage of indoor space.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Building  construction and management and facility management belong to the first  category. While the main focus of the first category are on building components  such as roofs and walls, the second category is focused on usage and  localization of features (stationary or mobile) in indoor space. The indoor  spatial information of the second category is to represent spatial components  such as rooms and corridors, and constraints such as doors. For example, indoor  location-based services, indoor route analysis or indoor geo-tagging services  belong to the second category. <br />
            The  goal of this standard is therefore to define a framework of indoor spatial  information to locate stationary or mobile features in indoor space and to provide  spatial information services referring their positions in indoor space, instead  of representing building architectural components. IndoorGML is intended to  provide the following functions;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Representing the properties of indoor  space, and</li>
            <li>Providing spatial reference of  features in indoor space.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note  that the IndoorGML version 1 is based on the requirements from indoor  navigation due to strong and urgent standardization demands, such as indoor  LBS, routing services, and emergency control in indoor space. We expect that  other requirements including indoor facility management will be handled by the  next version of IndoorGML.</p>
          <p><a href="#Top">[Back to top]</a></p>
          <h3><a name="Concepts"></a>2. General concepts of IndoorGML </h3>
          <p>An  important difference of indoor space from outdoor is that an indoor space is  composed of complicated constraints such as corridors, doors, stairs,  elevators, etc., like a road network space is composed of road constraints. It  means that proper representations of indoor constraints are key issues of  indoor spatial information modelling and standards.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cellular  space</strong>: indoor  space as a set of <em>cells</em>, which are  defined as the smallest organizational or structural unit of indoor space <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu"> [Wordnet,  Princeton University, 2010]</a>. Cellular space has important properties. First,  every cell has an identifier (namely <em>c.</em>ID)  such room number. Second, each cell may have common boundary with others but  does not overlap with other cells. Third, postion in cellular space can be  specified by cell identifier, although we may employ (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>) coordinates to specify a position for  more precise location. 
              <br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Semantic  representation</strong>: Semantic  is an important characteristic of cells. In  IndoorGML, semantics is used for two purposes: to provide classification and to  identify a cell and determines the connectivity between cells. Semantics allows  to define cells which can be of importance for navigation. For example, the  most commonly used classification of cells in topolographic space is into  navigable (rooms, corridors, doors) and non-navigable (walls, obstacles) cells. 
              <br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Geometric  representation</strong>: The geometric  representation of 2D or 3D feature in indoor space does not belong to the major  focus of IndoorGML, since they are clearly defined by <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26012&commid=54904">ISO 19107</a>, <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/citygml">CityGML</a>, and  <a href="http://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/ifc/model-industry-foundation-classes-ifc">IFC</a>. However, for the sake of self-completeness, the geometry of 2D or 3D  object may be optionally defined within IndoorGML according the data model defined  by ISO 19107. There are three options to represent the geometry of a cell in  IndoorGML as Figure 1;. <br />
              <br />
              [Figure 1 - Geometry in IndoorGML]
              <br />
              <img src="images/threeoptions.png" alt="" name="FigureOne" width="572" height="274" id="FigureOne" />
              <ol>
                <li>External  Reference (Option 1): Instead of explicit representation of geometry in  IndoorGML, an IndoorGML document only contains external links (namely <em>c.</em>xlink, where <em>c</em> is a cell in IndoorGML) to objects defined in other data sets  such as CityGML, where the referenced objects in external data set include  geometric information. Then there must be 1:1 or <em>n</em>:1 mappings from cells in IndoorGML to corresponding objects in  other dataset.</li>
                <li>Geometry  in IndoorGML (Option 2): Geometric representation of cell (namely <em>c.</em>geom, where <em>c</em> is a cell in IndoorGML) may be included within an IndoorGML  document. It is GM_Solid in 3D space and GM_Surface in 2D space as defined in  ISO 19107. Note that solid with holes or surface with holes are allowed in this  standard.  </li>
                <li>No Geometry (Option 3): No geometric information  is included in IndoorGML document.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Topological  representation</strong>: Topology  is an essential component of cellular space and IndoorGML.The Node-Relation Graph (NRG) <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:GEIN.0000034820.93914.d0">[J.Lee 2004]</a> represents topological relationships, e.g., adjacency and  connectivity, among indoor objects.  The NRG allows  abstracting, simplifying, and representing topological relationships among 3D spaces in indoor environments, such as rooms within a  building. It can be implemented as a graph representing the adjacency,  connectivity relationships without geometrical properties. It enables the  efficient implementation of complex computational problems within indoor  navigation and routing systems. The  Poincaré duality [<a href="http://tocs.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/94482942.pdf">JR Munkres 1984</a>] provides a theoretical background for mapping indoor space  to NRG representing topological relationships. A given indoor space can be  transformed into a NRG in topology space using the Poincaré duality. It  simplifies the complex spatial relationships between 3D by a combinatorial (or  logical) topological network model [25]. According to Poincaré duality, a <em>k-</em>dimensional object in <em>N-</em>dimensional primal space is mapped to  (<em>N-</em>k) dimensional object in dual  space. Thus solid 3D objects in 3D primal space, e.g., rooms within a building,  are mapped to nodes (0D object) in dual space. 2D surfaces shared by two solid  objects is transformed into an edge (1D) linking two nodes in dual space. <br />
              <br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Layered  Representation</strong>: A  single indoor space is often semantically interpreted into different cellular  spaces. For example, an indoor space is represented as a topographic cellular  space composed of rooms, corridors, and stairs, while it is also represented as  different cellular spaces with WiFi coverage cells and RFID sensor coverage  cells respectively as the following figure. For this reason, IndoorGML supports  multiple representation layers with different cellular spaces for an indoor  space. Each semantic interpretation layer results in a different decomposition  of the same indoor space, where each decomposition forms a separate layer of cellular  space.<br />
              <br />
              [Figure 2 - Multi-Layered Representation]<br />

          <h3><a name="SSM"></a>3. Structured Space Model</h3> 
          <p>IndoorGML  is based on two conceptual frameworks namely <em>Structured Space Model</em> and <em>Multi-Layered  Space Model</em> (MLSM). The Structured Space Model defines the general layout  of each space layer independent from the specific space model which it  represents. Each layer is systematically subdivided into four segments (see Figure 3). <br />
            <br />
          [Figure 3 - Structured Space Model]          <br />
          <img name="SSM" src="images/SSM.png" width="500" height="349" alt="" />          </p>
          <p>This figure illustrates the structured space model that allows for the distinct separation of primal space from dual space on the one hand, and geometry and pure topology on the other hand. This structure forms the basis for the framework proposed indoor space model. 
            The upper and the lower part of the figure follows the rules of ISO 19107 for modelling geometrical features of real world phenomena, but the transition from primal to dual space cannot be modelled or described via the ISO standard. And topological relationships in IndoorGML such as adjacency and connectivity are not defined by means of the topology in ISO 19107 but by explicit associations within the IndoorGML data model. 
            In the Structured Space Model, topological relationships between 3D (or 2D) spatial objects are represented within topology space (i.e., the lower part of the figure). By applying a duality transformation, the 3D cells in primal space are mapped to nodes (0D) in dual space. The topological adjacency relationships between 3D cells are transformed to edges (1D) linking pairs of nodes in dual space. Furthermore, the node of NRG is called state and the edge of NRG is called transition. The active state is represented by a node within the NRG and denotes the spatial area where the guided object is currently located. Once the object moves into a topologically connected area, another node within the NRG and thus a new active state is reached. The edge connecting both nodes represents the event of this state transition. The NRG representing topological relationships among 3D spatial objects in topological space is a logical NRG, while the NRG embedded to Euclidean IR3 space is a geometric NRG.</p>
          <p>The  UML diagram depicted in Figure 4 shows the data model for the Structured Space  Model. A SpaceLayer represents  a separate interpretation and a decomposition layer  and it is composed of States and  Transitions  which represent nodes and edges of NRG for dual space, respectively. The NRG  and state-transition diagram for each layer are realized by SpaceLayer. Note that the current version of  IndoorGML supports logical NRG and geometric NRG for dual space. <br />
          As  mentioned above, NRG as part of the Structured Space Model is implemented in  IndoorGML model. In dual space, the logical NRG in the lower right part of structured  space model as seen in the previous figure represents topological relationships among  spaces in topological space, which is described as the cardinality of State and Transition to <em>Geometry</em> classes is 0 in this figure. When the cardinality is 1 in the figure, the  topological model is implemented by coordinate space embedding of NRG (Geometric  NRG), which is in the lower left part of structured space model as seen in Figure 3.</p>
          <p>[Figure 4 - Data Model for Structured Space Model]<br />

<p><a href="#Top">[Back to top]</a></p>
      <h3><a name="MLSM"></a>4. Multi-Layered Space Model</h3>
	  <p>The  concept of Structure Space model is further extended to <em>Multi-Layered  Space Model</em> (MLSM). Multi-Layered Space Model provides an  approach for combining multiple  space structures for different interpretations and decomposition layers to  support full indoor information services. </p>
	<p>A  same indoor space is often differently interpreted depending on application  requirements as discussed above. It results in different  decompositions of a same indoor space, and each decomposition results in a NRG.  For example, the layers for topographic space layer, WIFI sensor space layer,  and RFID sensor space form independent structured spaces and each  layer results in three separate NRGs as depicted in Figure 5.</p>
	<p>[Figure 5 - Multi-Layered Space Model]<br />
	  <img src="images/MLSM.PNG" width="500" height="386" alt="MLSM" /></p>

<p> Layers of multi-layered space model can be connected by inter-layer relations. In the following example of Figure 6, there are three space layers, where each layer constitutes a NRG.  In a topographic layer, the nodes represent the possible states of a navigating object and correspond to cells with volumetric extent in primal space (e.g. rooms) while the edges represent state transitions, i.e., the movement of an object from one space to another. They correspond to connectivity relations between the cells in primal space (e.g., neighboured rooms connected with a door). In the sensor space, NRG has a slightly different structure. The nodes represent again the cells with volumetric extend (e.g. the entire coverage space of a WIFI transmitter), while the edges represent the transition from one space to another based on the neighbouring WIFI coverage spaces.  Since the layers cover the same real world space, the separated dual graphs can be combined into a multi-layered graph
<p>[Figure 6 - NRG for Multi-Layered Space Model]<br />
  . <img src="images/MLSM-interlayer.png" width="700" height="475" alt="MLSM-interlayer" /><br />
      <p>If we assume that each space model,  whether it is for topographic or sensor space, is  based upon a non-overlapping partitioning of space, a navigating object can  only belong to one cell at a time and thus always only one state may be active. Therefore, an object is at any given time exactly  in one cell (named <em>state</em>)  in each layer simultaneously. This overall state is thereby denoted by the combination  of active states from all space layers.</p>
          <p>However, only specific combinations of states  from different layers are valid and can be active at the same time. The  combinations are expressed by additional edges linking the nodes between  different layers. These so called <em>joint  edges</em> are derived by pairwise intersecting the cell geometries from  different layers. A joint edge between two such nodes is inserted if the  intersection of the interior of the two corresponding cells is non-empty.  Therefore, the joint edges represent all relationships according to the eight  relation model defined in <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa">[OGC Simple Feature Geometry]</a> except &ldquo;disjoint&rdquo; and &ldquo;touch&rdquo; between two cells from different  space layers and thus denote <em>inter-layer relationships</em>.		</p>
      <p>In  IndoorGML, the space model for multi-layered space representation, called <em>multi-layered space model</em>, is  implemented by MultiSpaceLayer class as shown in Figure 7. MultiLayeredGraph consists of SpaceLayers and InterLayerConnections, while SpaceLayer represents each space layer (e.g. topographic  space layer, sensor space layer, etc.) and it forms a NRG composed of objects  from Stateand Transition. The inter-layer relationships are implemented by InterLayerConnection class. In Figure 6, {(1,A,Within), (4,A,Within), (3,A,Cross), (3,AB,Cross), (3,B,Cross), (2,B, Within), (A,R1,Contains), (B,R2,Contains), (3,R1,Contains),(3,R2,Contains)} are the set of instances from InterLayerConnection  class, where each  instance represents the relationship between two cells of different space  layers of Figure 2. The MultiSpaceLayer is an aggregation of SpaceLayer and InterLayerConnection. </p>

<p><a href="#Top">[Back to top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="ExternRef"></a>5. External References</h3>
<p>Since the main focus of IndoorGML is on the notion  of cellular space and topological representation, it may  not contain geometries and detail semantic  information of indoor features. Instead, IndoorGML provides a method to  reference to an object in external dataset such as CityGML or IFC. Depending on  application areas, indoor features may have different geometric and semantic  representation models. For example, indoor spaces are often represented by grid  model in robotic domain. By separating domain specific representation model  from IndoorGML and providing external reference, a high level of flexibility  can be achieved. </p>

<p><a href="#Top">[Back to top]</a></p>

<h3><a name="Anchor"></a>6. Anchor Node - Connection between Indoor and Outdoor</h3>
<p>Connecting indoor and outdoor  spaces is an important requirement of indoor spatial information. IndoorGML  provides the concept of anchor node to connect indoor and outdoor spaces. We  employ additional topology to connect indoor and outdoor space. Every indoor  space contains at least one entrance, and it can be used to connect indoor and  outdoor spaces. In IndoorGML, entrance is represented as a special node of  topological graph in indoor space, connecting indoor and outdoor as shown in Figure  8. We call it <em>anchor node</em>, which  differs from other node in topological graph, since it may include additional  information for converting indoor CRS to outdoor absolute CRS. </p>
<p>[Figure 8 - Anchor Node]<br />
  <img src="images/Anchor.png" width="600" height="318" alt="Anchor" /></p>
<p> Anchor node contains attributes to support the seamless conversion between indoor and outdoor spaces. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>External reference to outdoor transportation network: Anchor node  includes an external reference to a node in ground transportation network,  which is connected to the anchor node as shown in Figure 16. Note that the  relationship betwteen anchor node and nodes in outdoor ground transportation is  bidirectional. The anchor nodes are not only defined within IndoorGML document  but also accessible from external data set such as ourdoor ground transportation  network. For example, when a vehicle is entering to a building, we can get the  IndoorGML document of the building via the external reference from the node in  the ground transportation network.</li>
  <li>Transformation parameters: In many cases, a relative CRS is applied to  an indoor space and it is necessary to transform the coordinates of each point  of indoor geometry according to the outdoor absolute CRS. Anchor node therefore  contains the parameters for transformation;    <br />
    <br />
<ul>
  <li> rotation origin point (<em>x</em>0, <em>y</em>0, <em>z</em>0)    </li>
      <li> rotation angles (<em>α</em>, <em>β</em>, <em>γ</em>,  along <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>-axis), </li>
      <li>rescaling factor (<em>sx</em>, <em>sy</em>, <em>sz</em>), and </li>
      <li> translation vector (<em>tx</em>, <em>ty</em>, <em>tz</em>).</li></ul>
    </li>
  <li>In addition to the above  attributes, we may include extra information such as radio map of the building  for WiFi indoor positioning. </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#Top">[Back to top]</a></p>
<h3><a name="Subspacing"></a>7. Subspacing</h3>
<p>Indoor  space has often hierarchical structures and a careful decomposition of an  indoor space is required in many cases to reflect hierarchical structures. A  feature such as corridor or hall may be divided to accurately represent the  geometric properties of indoor space based on the connectivity relationships  among space objects. </p>
<p>The subspacing by the first option is explained in Figure 9. In the  case of corridor of Figure 9-(a), node <em>n</em>6  in the NRG representing a corridor within the indoor space (Figure 9-(a),  Figure 9-(b)) is considered as a consolidated <em>Master Node</em>, which is transformed to a sub-graph preserving connectivity  relationship among the compartmentalized spaces of the corridor (Figure 9-(c)).  It means that node <em>n6</em> in  the original NRG is converted into <em>n</em>6-1  and <em>n</em>6-2 and edge <em>e</em>1 in Figure 9-(c)) in the  transformed NRG, which is a sub-graph representing a two-dimensional shape such  as a hallway.</p>
<p>[Figure 9 - Example of Subspacing]<br />
  <img src="images/subspacing-Example.png" width="700" height="239" alt="subspacing-example" /></p>
<p>IndoorGML  supports the subspacing by means of multi-layered space model to reflect  hierarchical structure of indoor space as shown in Figure 10. The NRG <em>G</em>1 is the original graph  layer with node <em>n</em>6, while <em>G</em>2 is a transformed graph  layer with partitioned nodes <em>n</em>6-1  and <em>n</em>6-2. Then the  hierarchical structure is represented by means of inter-layer connection of the  multi-layered space model. Note that there are default one-to-one inter-layer  connection between <em>G</em>1.<em>nk</em>, <em>G</em>2.<em>nk</em> except n6 as shown in Figure 10.</p>

<h3><a name="Modularization"></a>8. Modularization</h3>
<p>According to the OGC&rsquo;s policy <a href="https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=34762">&ldquo;The Specification  Model - A Standard for Modular specifications</a> &rdquo;, the overall IndoorGML is  split into a core module and extensions which have a mandatory dependency on  the core. Therefore, the IndoorGML data model is thematically decomposed into a  core module and thematic extension modules (see Figure 11). The core module comprise the basic concept and each  extension module covers a specific thematic field such as  navigation applications  (e.g. pedestrians, wheel-chair, and robot).  Each IndoorGML module is specified by an XML Schema definition file and is  defined within an individual and globally unique XML target namespace.  According to dependency relationships among modules, each module may, in  addition, import namespaces associated to such related IndoorGML modules.</p>
<p>[Figure 11 - Modular Structure of IndoorGML]<br />
  <img src="images/module.png" width="250" height="313" alt="module" /></p>
<p>The IndoorGML core module  defines the basic concepts and component of the IndoorGML data model. While the  aspects explained in section 2 except semantic modelling are reflected into  the core module, extension modules comprise the semantic modelling aspect  of IndoorGML. Based on the IndoorGML core module, the extension  module contains a logically separate thematic component of the IndoorGML data  model. IndoorGML introduces the first thematic extension module, called <em>IndoorNavigation</em> module.<br />
  The dependency relationships among IndoorGML&rsquo;s  modules are illustrated in Figure 11  using an UML package diagram. Each module is represented by a package. The  package name corresponds to the module name. A dash arrow in the figure  indicates that the schema at the tail of the arrow depends upon the schema at  the head of the arrow. For IndoorGML modules, a dependency occurs where one  schema &lt;import&gt;s other schema and accordingly the corresponding XML  namespace. In the following sections the modules are described in detail. </p>
